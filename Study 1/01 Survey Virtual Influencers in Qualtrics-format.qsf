Detecting The Difference in Trust Evaluations between virtual and human influencers<\/b><\/span><i> <\/i><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<b>Introduction<\/b><br \/>\n<br \/>\nWe invite you to take part in a research study being conducted by, Dr. Colin Conrad, who is a researcher at Dalhousie University, and by Anika Nissen, who is a visiting international researcher from University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<b>Purpose and Outline of the Research Study<\/b><br \/>\n<br \/>\nWith the growth of social media platforms, companies have started to more and more use social media and social media influencers as means to promote their products. Given that influencers gained great popularity, we are interested in how influencers are perceived with regard to trust and the likelihood to follow brand recommendations of influencers. By now, there are also computer-generated influencers, so called virtual influencers, that promote products and brands on Instagram which opens up new avenues. Some virtual influencers declare themselves as computer-generated, while others do not. The question arises here: will you be able to see the difference? In this study, you will get to see different Instagram posts from influencers &ndash; some of which are human, some are artificial, but we will not tell which is which. Our goal is to shine more light onto the perception and evaluation of the perceived trustworthiness of human versus virtual influencers using questionnaires.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<b>What You Will Be Asked to Do<\/b><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIf you decide to participate in this research, you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire including demographic data like age and gender, as well as your familiarity with using Instagram and your general attitude towards influencers on Instagram. We expect that this study will take less than 20 minutes to complete.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<b>How your information will be protected<\/b><br \/>\n<br \/>\nYour participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You do not have to answer questions that you do not want to, and you are welcome to stop the survey at any time if you no longer want to participate. All you need to do is close your browser tab or window. We will not include any incomplete surveys in our analyses. If you do complete your survey and you change your mind later, we will not be able to remove the information you provided as we will not know which response is yours. Your responses to the survey will be anonymous. We will describe and share our findings in journal and conference articles. We will only report group results and not individual results. This means that you will not be identified in any way in our reports.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;Anonymized data generated from the information you provide in this research may be shared publicly (most likely in digital form via the internet) to advance knowledge. We plan to deposit the data in the Dalhousie Scholars DataVerse repository and in a public research database called open science foundation (OSF). Though we do not collect any identifying information about you, we cannot guarantee your anonymity or predict how those who access the data will use them.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<b>Benefits, Possible Risks and Discomforts<\/b> There will be no direct benefit to you in participating in this research beyond the compensation of &pound;3. The research, however, might contribute to new knowledge related to ways of how people use social media and how they perceive virtual influencers. If you consent to participation, you will be compensated &pound;3, regardless of whether you finish the task. If you would like to see a summary of the results, please visit Dr. Conrad&rsquo;s website after December 2022: https:\/\/colinconrad.com\/study-results\/<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;You should discuss any questions you have about this study with Dr. Colin Conrad. Please ask as many questions as you like at any time. His contact information is provided below:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;Dr. Colin Conrad: colin.conrad@dal.ca<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;If you have any ethical concerns about your participation in this research, you may contact Research Ethics, Dalhousie University at (902) 494-3423, or email ethics@dal.ca (and reference REB file # 2022-6058).<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIf you agree to complete the survey, please continue.","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q113","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Are you human?
